## Project Description

This HR analytics project was developed as a capstone deliverable for the **Digital SkillUp Africa (DSA)** training program. It simulates a real-world scenario where I served as a junior analyst for **Palmoria Group**, tasked with investigating HR trends, rating equity, compensation patterns, and bonus allocation strategy using Microsoft Power BI.

The dashboard is interactive, multi-layered, and designed to help management gain deeper insight into internal workforce dynamics.

## Strategic Recommendations

**According to the Workforce Profile** I recommend Standardization of gender disclosure in HR records, promotion of women in Engineering and Product roles, localized diversity audits by region should be conducted and improve data hygiene to reduce ‚ÄúUndisclosed‚Äù fields.

In addition **For Compensation Compliance** there should be prioritization of equity reviews in Marketing, Engineering, Support.
    - Adjust salaries for underpaid roles with consistent high ratings.
    - Investigate departments with high pay gaps despite similar roles.
    - Make salary data completeness mandatory in HR processes.

**Performance & Ratings** shows that the management need to:
- Standardize rating rubrics across departments.
- Calibrate manager evaluations via feedback training.
- Model practices from high-performing Engineering teams.
- Promote peer recognition for female and underrepresented talent.

Bonus Allocation
- Ensure Abuja & Kaduna bonus weights align with actual performance, not geography.
- Combine performance data with bonus visuals to reveal causality.
- Spotlight high earners to drive engagement and fairness culture.
- Review location-based allocation strategy to encourage balance.
