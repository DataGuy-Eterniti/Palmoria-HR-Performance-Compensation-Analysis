# Palmoria-HR-Performance-Compensation-Analysis
This HR analytics project was developed as a capstone deliverable for the Digital SkillUp Africa (DSA) training program. It simulates a real-world scenario where I served as a junior analyst for Palmoria Group, tasked with investigating HR trends, rating equity, compensation patterns, and bonus allocation strategy using Microsoft Power BI.
